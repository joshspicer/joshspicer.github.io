**I got my amateur radio operator’s license — callsign `KK7VUA`!**

"Amateur" (or "ham") radio is a hobby that allows operators to communicate over radio frequencies allocated for personal use and technical exploration.  

Some "hams" are interested in radio-based contests (see [POTA](https://parksontheair.com/), [DX Watch](https://www.dxwatch.com/)).  Others may be interested in the hobby for emergency preparedness reasons (how would _you_ communicate with others if the internet weren't available anymore?), while I think others are drawn to the sense of community.  

What drew _me_ in were radio tools I was introduced to through the lens of penetration testing and cybersecurity.  These include things like the HackRF[^1] or Flipper Zero.  Jared Boone's talk on [Reversing Tire Pressure Monitors with a Software-Defined Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKqiq2Y43Wg) from a *decade* ago is still relevant today and really motivated me to learn more about the radio spectrum.  Amateur radio is (literally) your license to both transmit and receive with the express goal of experimentation - sounds perfect!

To start transmitting, you first need to study and pass an exam to demonstrate you understand the basic FCC and community guidelines.  Studying for the exam introduced me to a lot of interesting concepts like radio signal propagation and antenna design.  Be sure to check out [Ham Study](https://hamstudy.org/) if you're interested in getting licensed yourself!

After the exam, you're free to explore whatever you find interesting.  A good place to start is grabbing a cheap VHF/UHF handheld radio and finding [local repeaters](https://www.repeaterbook.com/index.php/en-us/) in your area (one that I can reach is from the [Puget Sound Repeater Group](https://web.psrg.org/)).  These repeaters expand your handheld's range to let you communicate beyond line-of-sight. Sometimes the clubs that maintain the repeaters host "nets" you can tune into.  Beyond voice, there's tons of [digital communication](https://aprs.fi/)[^2]: over the air, and even satellites (like the ISS) that you can attempt to make contact with!

[^1]: The creator of the HackRF, Michael Ossmann, has created [an awesome SDR course](https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/) that I highly recommend.
[^2]: [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) is another neat digital communication protocol that can be transmitted license-free!
