The [Inkplate 10](https://www.crowdsupply.com/soldered/inkplate-10) is an awesome, hackable e-ink display. It's a 9.7" display with a resolution of 1200x825. It's also a dev board, with an ESP32, SD card slot, and LiPo battery connector. I was first inspired to pick one up when I saw these [projects with a newspaper-like read out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35176824) on the front page of Hacker News.  Recently I thought of a more practical use for the Inkplate that i'd want to use almost daily - a digital, dynamic recipe book.

Recipes are quickly generated with data from [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/), parsed into LaTeX, then a PDF (to handle all the typesetting), and _finally_ a JPG that the Inkplate can render!  Let's take a closer look at the process...

## Generating the Recipe

> Pull my pre-built Docker image [`ghcr.io/joshspicer/eink`](https://github.com/joshspicer/eink/pkgs/container/eink) to try it yourself!  The source code for the project is also [on GitHub](https://github.com/joshspicer/eink).

I'm using the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to generate the recipe. It's a great service with a generous free tier. I'm using the [Recipe Search](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Recipes-Complex) endpoint to find a recipe based on a query. The query is a string that can be anything from a single ingredient to a full recipe name. For example, "chicken" will return a list of recipes that contain chicken (although I have it [hardcoded to vegetarian recipes only!](https://github.com/joshspicer/eink/blob/90f3a3e4b26d21bb6be02ea0ff2b75dbb7d197d7/server/templates/recipe/queryAndReplace.sh#L22)). A query like "chicken soup" will return a list of recipes that contain chicken and soup. "chicken noodle soup" will return a list of recipes that contain chicken, noodle, and soup. You get the idea.

The Spoonacular response looks [something like this](https://github.com/joshspicer/eink/blob/e09f54c2be86daf10d0d4cfd0f0a7ecf75120cd8/meta/recipes/spoonacular-example/response.json), which then needs to be parsed and typeset into something presentable.

If you pull my docker image and set a `SPOONACULAR_API` API key in your a `.env` file, you can generate a typeset recipe image with the following `curl`:

```bash
$ docker run --rm --name eink --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 eink
$ curl -X PATCH \
    -d '{\"mealQuery\": \"strawberry\"}' \
    http://localhost:3000/update?mode=recipe

Accepted # Or 'Bad Request/Internal Server Error'. Check your logs with 'docker logs eink'
```

Internally the tool is retrieving data in the following way:

> There's a ton of Spoonacular functionality i'm not taking advantage of here - like [generating a meal plan](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Generate-Meal-Plan), [generating a shopping list](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Generate-Shopping-List), and [filtering recipes based on very specific dietary and/or macro-nutrient requirements](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Nutrition-by-ID).  


```bash
RECIPE=$(curl "https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch?query=$QUERY&diet=vegetarian&addRecipeInformation=true&fillIngredients=true&number=1" -H "x-api-key: $SPOONACULAR_API" | jq '.results[0]')
```



## Parsing the Recipe

The parsing is done in a [bash script and is not for the faint of heart](https://github.com/joshspicer/eink/blob/main/server/templates/recipe/queryAndReplace.sh).  Ultimately, the script takes the JSON response from Spoonacular and convert it into lines of LaTeX.

```bash
# ... snip ...

# Replace pointers
sed -i "s/$RECIPE_TITLE/$title/g" /output/template.tex
sed -i "s/$INGREDIENT_POINTER/$I_LATEX/g" /output/template.tex
sed -i "s/$METHOD_POINTER/$M_LATEX/g" /output/template.tex
```

## Typesetting the Recipe

At the end of the previous routine, we ended with a `template.tex` file where [markers in the template file, like `%%%INGREDIENT_POINTER%%%`](https://github.com/joshspicer/eink/blob/90f3a3e4b26d21bb6be02ea0ff2b75dbb7d197d7/server/templates/recipe/template.tex#L61-L63) were replaced with the parsed recipe:

```latex
\begin{recipeingredients}
\ingredient{0.5 oz almond }
\ingredient{0.25 cup kiwi }
\ingredient{0.5 cup milk  (organic)}
\ingredient{0.5 cup greek yogurt  (plain)}
\ingredient{0.25 cup raspberries }
\ingredient{1 cup strawberries  (frozen)}
\end{recipeingredients}
```

The LaTeX template utilized here is called 'Jacopo Recipe' by [vel](mailto:vel@latextemplates.com). The template is bundled in the provided Docker image.

The next step is to typeset the LaTeX into a PDF.  The bulk of this project's [Dockerfile](https://github.com/joshspicer/eink/blob/main/server/Dockerfile) size is dedicated to installing the necessary LaTeX packages to typeset and compile the document into a PDF.  

```bash
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode /output/template.tex
```

The [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) project is then used to convert the PDF into various file formats, namely BMP (if using the [native Inkplate `drawImage()` function](https://github.com/joshspicer/eink/blob/90f3a3e4b26d21bb6be02ea0ff2b75dbb7d197d7/sketch/sketch.ino#L103)) and JPG (if using the `esphome` approach i'll outline below).

```bash
# Jpg

convert /output/template.pdf -quality 100 /output/output.jpg  # Native resolution
convert /output/output.jpg -resize "${INKPLATE_WIDTH}x${INKPLATE_HEIGHT}" /output/resized.jpg  # Resize to Inkplate's dimensions
cp /output/resized.jpg "${BASE_DESINATION_PATH}/image.jpg"

# Bmp

convert /output/template.pdf  -quality 100 -depth 1 /output/output.bmp
cp /output/output_5.bmp "${BASE_DESINATION_PATH}/image.bmp"
```

Both `image.jpg` and `image.bmp` are then available as static assets served by the project's node server.  Go ahead, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/image.jpg` and you'll see the recipe JPG in your browser!

## Rendering on the Inkplate

### A. Uploading sketch

There's a few ways i've tossed around pushing the generated recipes to the Inkplate.  My first solution can be run standalone by flashing [this sketch](https://github.com/joshspicer/eink/blob/main/sketch/sketch.ino) to the device.  The `downloadAndshowImage()` will download the image from whatever URL you provide it and then deep sleeps (although the deep sleep is a bit finicky).

```c
bool downloadAndShowImage()
{
    // Craft bitmap URL
    char bitmapUrl[100];
    sprintf(bitmapUrl, "%s/image.bmp", baseAddress);

    // Draw the first image from web.
    // Monochromatic bitmap with 1 bit depth. Images like this load quickest.
    // NOTE: Both drawImage methods allow for an optional fifth "invert" parameter. Setting this parameter to true
    // will flip all colors on the image, making black white and white black. This may be necessary when exporting
    // bitmaps from certain softwares. Forth parameter will dither the image.
    if (!display.drawImage(bitmapUrl, 0, 0, false, false))
    {
        // If is something failed (wrong filename or wrong bitmap format), write error message on the screen.
        // REMEMBER! You can only use Windows Bitmap file with color depth of 1, 4, 8 or 24 bits with no compression!
        return false;
    }
    display.display();
    return true;
}
```
### B. Esphome

The second approach - if you have Home Assistant running - is to flash the device with [esphome](https://web.esphome.io/?dashboard_logs), adopt it through the Home Assistant UI, and build with the [Inkplate component](https://esphome.io/components/display/inkplate6.html).  This method relies on OTA updates to update the embedded recipe image. 

The YAML you'll want to flash to your device is similar to:

```yaml
esphome:
  name: inkplate

esp32:
  board: esp-wrover-kit

logger:

wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password
  ap: {}

captive_portal:

ota:

# Enable Home Assistant API
api:
  encryption:
    key: "..."

i2c:

mcp23017:
  - id: mcp23017_hub
    address: 0x20

time:
  - platform: sntp
    id: esptime

image:
  - file: http://<YOUR_SERVER>/image.jpg
    id: remote_img
    resize: 825x1200
  
# ... Configure deep sleep settings you require.
#     I used this video as a starting point for configuring 
#     automatic OTA updates and deep sleep:
#     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfpaSAlecMk

# deep_sleep:

display:
- platform: inkplate6
  id: inkplate_display
  greyscale: false
  partial_updating: false
  update_interval: 30s
  model: inkplate_10 # Make sure to update this if you have an Inkplate 10!
  rotation: 270      # To make the screen display in our recipe portrait

# ... potentially other config as seen in the Inkplate esp home example
#     https://esphome.io/components/display/inkplate6.html#complete-inkplate-6-example

  # The colors here are "flipped" from what's intuitive, so the 'fill' is needed to clear the screen.
  lambda: |-
    it.fill(COLOR_ON);
    it.image(0, 0, id(remote_img), COLOR_OFF, COLOR_ON); 
```

The tricky part is that now the image is _embedded_ in the firmware.  It's easy to re-flash the firmware through Home Assistant's UI, but I wanted the screen to be able to magically pull whatever recipe was on my mind.  To do that, one can install the 'Advanced SSH & Web Terminal' Home Assistant add-on with 'Protection Mode' disabled (the community add-on, not the official one) and then set up a cron to run the following command in the `esphome` container.

> Make sure to update the config (`esphome-web-xxxxxx.yaml`) and host name (`inkplate.local`) to your values!

```bash
esphome run /config/esphome/esphome-web-xxxxxx.yaml --device inkplate.local --no-logs
```

As long as the device is connected to the network (not deep sleeping), this will re-flash whatever image is at `/image.jpg` on the server!

## Inkplate Hardware

To wrap up, I printed the [official 3D case](https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Soldered-Inkplate-10-hardware-design/blob/main/CAD/V1.3.1/Source%203D%20files/Soldered%20Inkplate%2010%20v1.3.0.%20Case.step) provided by Inkplate and mounted it to the wall. I attached a LiPo battery I already had so that I could leave the device unplugged except when to charge!

## Setting a recipe

Once the server and Inkplate are set up, the cadence and means of updating the recipes is very flexible.  What I did was set up a quick Siri Shortcut to trigger the container running on my local network.  A couple times a day my Inkplate will wake up and re-flash itself to include any updates to `/image.jpg`. 

> With the Shortcut set up, I can even ask Siri instead of typing in the recipe!

I also set up a simple [Telegram Bot](https://joshspicer.com/openwrt-alert) to send me the ingredents list so I can pick them up when I go shopping!
