> ðŸ‘‹ **[Sept 2024]** I've made _lots_ of improvements to both the service (now hosted as an [Azure Function](https://github.com/joshspicer/functions/blob/main/src/functions/heartbox.ts)) and the ESP module programming (using an [esphome config](https://github.com/joshspicer/functions/blob/main/src/esphome/heartbox.yaml)).  Read this post and then check out these updated links!

This past Christmas I set out to make a DIY ["lovebox"](https://sos.lovebox.love/hc/en-us/articles/360019948231-What-is-the-Lovebox-) as a gift. These devices come in pairs - each device at a different location.  When one person performs some trigger, the peer device lights up. It's a fun and passive way to let your partner know you're thinking of them.

I thought it would be fun (and _way_ cheaper!) to try and build the product myself. Below are the steps and associated code if you'd like to create one yourself!

## Parts

- 2x ESP8266 boards (I used [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081PX9YFV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title)) because they were a good size and required minimal soldering.
- LEDs to solder onto the boards (I used red)
- Some kind of transparent film to place over the hearts (the material I had wasn't great, open to suggestions!)
- 3D printed box (see below)
- Soldering iron
 
## Quickstart

If you to try the project for yourself:

- Pull [`ghcr.io/joshspicer/lovebox`](https://github.com/joshspicer/lovebox/pkgs/container/lovebox) and start the docker container
- Update the `variables.h` file, setting the first unit as `me=1` and `peer=2` (and vice versa for the second box)
- Flash [sketch.ino](https://github.com/joshspicer/lovebox/blob/main/lovebox.ino) to your boards that have an LED soldered onto the correct pin.

### Hardware and 3D Model

For the 3D model, I had in mind a "companion cube" from Portal. I found a [model by mooraayeelz](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5186012) online that fit the bill perfectly!  I printed two on my Ender 3 with default PLA settings.  I printed the base separately in a different color for some contrast.

As shown in the parts list, I used ESP8266 boards. I soldered the LEDs to GPIO pin 2 on the boards with a resistor appropriate for the LEDs I had on hand.  I used a hot glue gun and some screws to attach things in place.  I also snaked through a USB cable that sneaks out the back of the box for power.

### Software

Each box is assigned an identifier (1 or 2) and a peer (the other box).  The boxes are programmed to listen for a message from the peer and turn on the LED when a message is received.

```c
#include <Arduino.h>

const char *ssid = "<TODO>";
const char *password = "<TODO>";
String me = "1";
String peer = "2";
String baseAddress = "http://<TODO>:3000";

String getMeAddress = baseAddress + "/?user=" + me;
String provisionMeAddress = baseAddress + "/provision?user=" + me;
String postPeerAddress = baseAddress + "/?user=" + peer;
```

I wrote a simple node server to run in the cloud and coordinate the "on" and "off" states.  Each device is programmed to retrieve configuration at `/provision` startup from the coordination server with its id.

The simple state machine is maintained in-memory:
```js
if (userObj.enable === 1 && userObj.ack === 0) {
    console.log(`[+] User '${userObj.id}' ack. Queuing disable for '${enableDurationInSeconds}' seconds.`);
    userObj.ack = 1;
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(`[*] Disabling user ${userObj.id}`)
        userObj.enable = 0;
        userObj.ack = 0;
    }, enableDurationInSeconds * 1000);
} else if (userObj.enable === 1 && userObj.ack === 1) {
    console.log(`[no-op] User '${userObj.id}' is already active.`)
} else {
    console.log(`[no-op] User '${userObj.id}' is not enabled.`);
} 
```

Simple, yet effective!  I've also provided commented sections in the sketch where a Basic authentication header can be added to the HTTP requests.  For example, running these services in an Azure Function and hardcoding in the shared secret would be a good way to secure the endpoints.

## Triggering with a Siri Shortcut

I wanted to be able to trigger the box with a Siri Shortcut to trigger the partner's device! I then added the shortcut to my home screen and added it to my home screen. These are easily shared though text - a great way to share with the gift's recipient!
