> This post is a stub and will be completed shortly!

Key Features:

- Habit Tracking: Track daily habits with a visual streak calendar
- Screen Time Management: Set limits on distracting apps and only unlock them after completing daily habits in-app
- Custom Plugin System: Install or create plugins that define challenges required to unlock apps. Build your own plugins in javascript and submit to https://github.com/joshspicer/habitbridgemarketplace for all to enjoy!
- Webhook Integration: Send your habit data to any system via webhooks, including Home Assistant. This allows for advanced automations to trigger when habits are completed (home assistant plugin coming soon)
- Widget Support: Track habits and progress with convenient home screen and lock screen widgets

The webhook and import/export JSON schema is a work in progress and subject to change.
